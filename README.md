# Fake News Detection

This repository contains comparison of data mining algorithms for Fake news in [WELFake datset](https://zenodo.org/records/4561253). Following classification model are applied:

-   Navie Bayes Classifier
-   Decision Trees
-   Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-   Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
-   Linear and Logistic Regression
-   k-Nearest Neigbhour </br>
    To assess their performance, key
    metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are meticulously employed for each model.
